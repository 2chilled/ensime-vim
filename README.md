ENSIME for the Editor of the Beast (Vim)

Needs some love. Please get in contact if you would like to help! There was some old work that is no longer compatible with the ENSIME server but it may serve as a good starting place:

* https://github.com/megaannum/vimside
* https://github.com/jlc/envim
* https://github.com/psuter/vim-ensime \ https://github.com/andreypopp/ensime

Reference launch script is https://gist.github.com/fommil/4ff3ad5b134280de5e46 (only works on Linux but should be adaptable to OS X)
